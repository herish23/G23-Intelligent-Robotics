## kidnap problem blueprint for each algorithm 
## we just make the robto dispaper at timestamp 500 

experiment:
  name: "kidnap"
  description: "Kidnapped robot recovery test - reset belief mid-run"

kidnapping:
  timestep: 500                    ## when to trigger kidnapping (update step number)
  recovery_threshold: 0.5          ## error below this = considered recovered (meters)
  tracking_window: 200             ## steps after kidnap to track recovery metrics

  ## amcl 
  particle_filter:
    reset_mode: "global"           
    n_particles_kidnap: 5000       

  ekf:
    reset_covariance: 100.0        ## set P diagonal to this value (high uncertainty)
    reset_cov_x: 100.0             ## x position variance (m^2)
    reset_cov_y: 100.0             ## y position variance (m^2)
    reset_cov_theta: 3.14          ## theta variance (rad^2)

  markov:
    reset_mode: "uniform"          ## reset all grid cells to uniform probability
